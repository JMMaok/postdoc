# postdoc
This GitHub was created to house a collection of open datasets for the study of postdoctoral scholars and appointments.

The first dataset being developed is the Postdoc Legal Research Open Notebook. The rest of this readme refers specifcially to that project.

Based on the lab notebook model common in the life sciences, this is an open notebook living systematic review of legal documents related to postdoctoral scholars and appointments. This project is created and maintained by Melania Abrahamian, Adriana Bankston and Jennifer Miller. 

If you are interested in contributing to the project, please message one of the organizers, watch the project, or add a comment on the issue that interests you. You are welcome to join the project by contributing in any of the following areas:

**Literature review**
The project is informed by the following earlier work: 

Miller, J.M. and Van Buskirk, K.N. (2013). A view of the lab bench from the judicial bench: postdoctoral scholars and the legal system. Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy, Atlanta, GA September 18.

**Theory** 

Briefly, we are looking at the question of whether postdocs are employees or students. Applying microeconomic theory, if postdocs are employees they are producers in a labor market, probably one in which the employer has significant market power (monopsony). If postdocs are students, they are consumers in a service market, probably one where producers differentiate based on based on features (monopolistic competition). The different types of markets will tend to be associated with different types of legal cases. By examining empirically in which types of cases postdocs are most frequently involved, we will make the case for whether postdocs are students or employees.

**Data**

Our dataset includes publicly available legal documents, such as appellate court decisions, that mention postdocs. 

**Methods**

We will apply methods of empirical legal research. In particular, we will prepare cross-tabulations of legal cases using categories such as date, type of case, type of institution, and role of postdoc in the case.

**Results**

The results section will summarize the findings of our analysis in a clear and replicable way.

**Discussion**

The discussion section will interpret the project's results, offer implications for policy and practice, and suggest directions for further research.

**Ethics**

This project is not human subjects research. The data includes only public documents and the the unit of analysis is the case, not the person. Do not make contributions to the project that go beyond this scope. If you extend the project beyond this scope, research ethics (IRB approval) is your responsibility.

**Licensing**

The dataset itself is placed to the full extent possible in the public domain with a CC0 designation. Other project topics will be published with a CC BY license to the extent it is practical to do so.
