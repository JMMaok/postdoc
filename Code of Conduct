This project operates subject to the GitHub Terms of Service https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the the Terms. Briefly, here is a summary of acceptable use: 

"GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other."

As organizers, we also expect contributions and interactions within this project to be consistent with the GitHub Community Guidelines https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines and GitHub Forum Standards of Conduct https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct. 

Content warning: While there are ways for people of all ages to contribute to the project, the transcripts that make up the postdoc legal research dataset contain descriptions of workplace harassment that are probably not suitable for children without close adult supervision.
